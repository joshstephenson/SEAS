00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,668
and surrounding
residential, commercial,

357
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,135
and mixed communities,

358
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,899
Governor Dutton
has violated state law

359
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:00,467
and his sworn oath of office

360
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:04,200
to act in the best
interests of the state.

361
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:07,235
He has exposed the state
to litigation,

362
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,267
which I have been
informed is forthcoming.

363
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:14,135
He has robbed the state
of billions in tax revenue

364
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,301
and thousands of jobs.

365
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:18,966
By doubling taxes
on non-residents

366
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,699
and initiating a sales tax
on non-residents,

367
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:25,168
<i>he</i> threatens to extinguish

368
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:29,891
our state's single biggest
generator of revenue: Tourism.

369
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,999
These are callous,
calculated actions

370
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:38,334
that are only in the best
interest of the governor himself

371
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:41,301
and will have
devastating consequences

372
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:44,301
for our constituents,

373
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:47,224
the people who elected us.

374
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,790
The reason we are here.

375
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,934
John: Progress. It's, uh...

376
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,135
seems that's all
ever talk about.

377
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,168
But I never talk about what
the word actually means...

378
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:04,999
it means "to proceed,"
"to move forward," that's all.

379
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,667
Typically we interpret moving
forward as better...

380
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:10,368
better for us as a people,
better for the planet,

381
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:13,667
which is usually better
for us as a people.

382
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:16,435
And if we use it in that manner

383
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,400
I agree.

384
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,667
But when something benefits one
group over another group

385
00:24:21,691 --> 00:24:23,501
you can't use that word anymore.

386
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:25,699
You must use another word.
You must use "bias,"

387
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:28,800
you must use "favoritism."

388
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:31,867
Running a pipeline beneath
the drinking water

389
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:34,501
of an already strained
and impoverished community

390
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:36,899
may be progress for the owners
of the pipeline

391
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:39,600
or owners of whatever
runs through the pipeline

392
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:41,135
or for those receiving it

393
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,301
but it could lead
to disastrous effects

394
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:48,267
to the land and the people
this pipeline runs beneath.

395
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,934
Which is not progress at all.

396
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,501
And it is for those people,

397
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,267
and for the future of Montana...

398
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,667
And for that reason,
as governor of Montana,

399
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:01,467
I cannot support that endeavor
and will use the full weight

400
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:04,168
of my office to prevent
it from happening.

401
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:06,168
That the Attorney General's
office, under Article 5,

402
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:09,135
and section 13
of the State Constitution,

403
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,990
is requesting a Senate
Tribunal seeking impeachment.

404
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:17,235
[murmuring]

405
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,334
- I didn't expect that.
- [applause]

406
00:25:19,358 --> 00:25:20,459
Me neither.

407
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,467
Well thank you, Governor.

408
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,435
You, uh, took my whole speech.

409
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:29,766
That's what I was going to say.

410
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,135
[laughter]

411
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,533
The President visited
us last week.

412
00:25:34,557 --> 00:25:35,899
[phone dings]

413
00:25:35,923 --> 00:25:39,566
He spoke about improving
the quality of life here.

414
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,334
He spoke of the schools, our
health clinics, our sovereignty.

415
00:25:44,358 --> 00:25:45,667
[clamoring]

416
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:46,999
Woman: Read this.

417
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,667
Oh my God.

418
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:51,135
Governor Dutton, can you
respond to the charges?

419
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:52,435
What are they saying?

420
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:53,899
Read this, John.

421
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,501
[indistinct chatter]

422
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:57,600
Governor Dutton, do you
have a comment, sir?

423
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,533
Have you read that report?

424
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,168
This is why I said he's not
fit for this office.

425
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:06,200
Don't answer any questions
just leave.

426
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,667
Man: Governor.

427
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,633
- It appears you got ambushed.
- Yeah, it looks that way.

428
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:15,800
If I'd known this was going to
happen I wouldn't have come.

429
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,435
So what do you have to say?

430
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,301
[sniffs]

431
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:21,499
Excuse me.
[reporters stop talking]

432
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:23,135
This moment isn't about me.

433
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,334
And I won't let it be.

434
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:27,867
The issues facing this
reservation are real.

435
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:30,267
Far more real than any theater
being played out

436
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,966
in Helena right now.

437
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,800
Keep your focus on the issue of
today because it will still

438
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:36,699
be one tomorrow.
Thank you.

439
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:38,723
[clamoring]

440
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:42,159
[music]

441
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:52,734
Clara: He can't point
to a single code

442
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:54,600
or conduct violation.

443
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:57,135
He talks about litigation
and damages but no litigation

444
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,267
has been filed so there's no
damages to consider.

445
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:01,490
His entire impeachment claim
is conjecture.

446
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,135
Sometimes conjecture is all
you need to get started.

447
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,334
Truth prevails.

448
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:10,490
It's not that kind
of fight, Clara.

449
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:14,400
Truth won't win this one.

450
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,824
Well if truth won't win it,
I don't know what will.

451
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:20,691
Menace.

452
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,438
I don't know how
to fight with menace.

453
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,923
I'll teach you.

454
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:30,159
[music]

455
00:27:57,523 --> 00:28:00,533
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

456
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:02,734
My father's gone.
Why aren't you with him?

457
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:04,434
I'm on house arrest.
I can't go with him.

458
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,633
Well, you were with him
at the county fair last night.

459
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:08,934
I don't make the rules.
He said to stay so I stayed.

460
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,699
Oh. Well, I'll say this:

461
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,934
When you forsake feminism
you go all in.

462
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,135
You're almost Amish.

463
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,999
I don't have a choice,
I'm fucking stuck here.

464
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:18,734
Don't sell me that
bullshit, Summer.

465
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:21,867
You were with him last
night at the country fair.

466
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:23,533
With his stormtroopers
on either side of us.

467
00:28:23,557 --> 00:28:25,434
Well, you didn't look
like much of a captive

468
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,699
sucking his tongue
down your throat.

469
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:30,367
It's hard to play the victim,
Summer, whiles you're on top.

470
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:31,999
Why does it bother you
so much that

471
00:28:32,023 --> 00:28:33,699
I see in him exactly
what you see?

472
00:28:33,723 --> 00:28:36,800
I have no desire
to suck my father's face.

473
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:37,833
You know what I mean.

474
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,267
Where's your dad live, huh?

475
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,999
I'll go fuck him.

476
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:44,566
Don't touch my Tito's.

477
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,057
I drink Scotch.

478
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,800
Course you do, with your
hairy fucking armpits.

479
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:50,267
Oh, and let's get
one thing clear:

480
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,600
You touch
my peanut M in the freezer.

481
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:54,135
I will kill you in your sleep.

482
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,159
I sleep with a knife.
And I have a peanut allergy.

483
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:01,533
You know, we might make
it through this.

484
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:02,534
If you're done insulting me

485
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:03,959
I have something
I need to show you.

486
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:06,435
Come here.

00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:07,734

You pulling out?

504
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,999
My family pulled
about an hour ago.

505
00:30:43,023 --> 00:30:45,066
You were working and
I didn't want to interrupt,

506
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,367
but I wanted to
say goodbye, and...

507
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:50,258
I don't know, maybe
we could go and, I dunno...

508
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:54,466
If your family's gone
how are you gonna get home?

509
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,200
I have my truck here.

510
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,234
- You can drive?
- Of course.

511
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:00,200
How old do you think I am?

512
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:01,800
Wait...
How old are you?

513
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,168
No, I didn't mean, like,
'can you drive'

514
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:05,057
of course you can drive,
it's just...

515
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,458
I don't have truck,
just a dumb cowboy.

516
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,566
What time you done working?

517
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,333
You don't have school tomorrow?

518
00:31:13,357 --> 00:31:15,399
It's summer.
Nobody has school tomorrow.

519
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:16,800
Right.

520
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,199
You're done with school?

521
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:21,223
I mean, uh... it's more
like school's done with me.

522
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,857
Well, I can wait for you,
if you want me to.

523
00:31:29,258 --> 00:31:30,758
I'd like that.

524
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,734
That's a lot to unsaddle.

525
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:36,568
You want a hand?

526
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:37,758
I ain't too proud to say no.

527
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:39,657
- Okay.
- Come on.

528
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:43,624
Grab that one.

529
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,633
I got two pots of coffee on.

530
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:52,333
Grab your mugs
and get 'em filled.

00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:54,633
It's not cold in Texas, is it?

532
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:56,057
You think it's cold here?

533
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,266
You gonna freeze the fuzz of
them little peaches down there.

534
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,199
Coldest I ever been
is prowling heifers

535
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,600
on the Pitchfork in January.

536
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:05,734
Pack everything you got.
Your long Johns, your jackets.

537
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,135
There ain't no trees to break
the wind where we're going.

538
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,135
And you won't call a
twenty-mile-an hour wind

539
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,399
a wind after a winter
down there, guys.

540
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:14,699
Better than here.
They're damn near to Mexico.

541
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:15,667
It's colder than
a mother-in-law's heart

542
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:16,601
down there, boys.

543
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:18,300
I'm telling you.
Just pack it.

544
00:32:18,324 --> 00:32:20,234
It's better it lives in the
truck than not to have it at all.

545
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:21,333
You gonna miss me?

546
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,434
I don't know
how to answer that considering

547
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,466
I was forced into
this relationship.

548
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,399
If you love something,
Teeter, set it free.

549
00:32:26,423 --> 00:32:27,400
I mean fuck that.

550
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:28,766
He lucky I ain't
chaining his ass

551
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,133
to the fucking radiator.

552
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,300
I don't know if going
back to Texas

553
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,667
is gonna be the best thing
for her speech therapy.

554
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:34,833
[laughs]

555
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:36,667
There it is, a zinger
from the cheap seats.

556
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,167
Rip: Shit, Ethan, I've known
you ten years,

557
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:39,766
and you finally said something
half-funny.

558
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,833
That was pretty fucking funny.

559
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:42,266
You get all them dresses packed?

560
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,867
Don't start that fucking shit.

561
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,057
They all gonna fit in there?

562
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,367
Don't fucking start it.

563
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:47,800
He's got 'em in a hanging
bag in the trailer.

564
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:49,657
[laughing]

565
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,266
All right, y'all, let's roll.

566
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,867
[music playing]

567
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,600
Rip: Lloyd.

568
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,300
I got it handled here, brother.

569
00:33:00,324 --> 00:33:01,434
I know you do.

570
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:01,967
You need anything,
you let me know.

571
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:03,357
You, too man.

572
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:08,490
Adios, boys.

573
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:11,223
See you, guys.

574
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:12,934
[shuffling cards]

575
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,199
Ethan: Play a little hold em?

576
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:16,266
Lloyd: Hell, ain't got
nothin' better to do.

577
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,157
[door shuts]

578
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:20,790
[music]

579
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:41,758
I'll fly out
and see you in a week.

580
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:49,523
I love you.

581
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:57,490
[music]

582
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:01,523
- See you in Texas.
- See you on Texas.

583
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:07,391
Teeter.

584
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:23,958
[whispers]
I... love... you.

585
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,157
[engine starts]

586
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:53,257
[music]

587
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:32,700
It was the perfect speech,
it was the perfect delivery.

588
00:35:32,724 --> 00:35:34,965
Everything about it was perfect.

589
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:37,157
- And you got the votes.
- [laughs]

590
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,858
He's gonna fight.

591
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:43,989
I don't doubt it.

592
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,133
[doorbell rings]

593
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:49,458
[pounding]

594
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:56,233
Oh, shit. It's my sister.

595
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,166
Just ignore her.
She'll go away.

596
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,657
You don't know my sister.

597
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:02,891
See?

598
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:05,499
[glass shatters]

599
00:36:05,523 --> 00:36:06,757
Shit. Jesus.

600
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:15,932
- Jamie?
- There's a term for this, Beth.

601
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,800
It's called
breaking and entering.

602
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:20,133
There's a term for
the reason I'm doing it:

603
00:36:20,157 --> 00:36:23,533
It's called career suicide,
and you fucking just did it.

604
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,733
Get the fuck out of my house!
Out of my house!

605
00:36:26,757 --> 00:36:28,690
- Get out!
- Fuck you, Jamie!

606
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:32,324
[groans]

607
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,932
Tomorrow, you will
call a press conference

608
00:36:36,956 --> 00:36:39,267
and you will resign from office.

609
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,233
Do you fucking
understand me, Jamie?

610
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:42,865
You will resign

611
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:45,922
or I'm printing photos
for the sheriff.

612
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,834
No, you're not.

613
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:53,733
Doubt me.
Doubt me, Jamie.

614
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,358
I am begging you.

615
00:36:56,557 --> 00:37:00,666
[sniffs]

616
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,767
How many <i>bodies</i>

617
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:06,999
has your father put
in the same spot?

618
00:37:07,023 --> 00:37:09,932
Turn me in and you turn him in.

619
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:11,657
Have you thought this through?

620
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:15,633
[laughs]

621
00:37:15,657 --> 00:37:17,898
Wait, did you even know?

622
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:20,166
Did you think I
just picked a turnout

623
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,599
on the Wyoming border
at fucking random?!

624
00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:26,056
There's a century's worth
of our family's secrets

625
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,499
down at the bottom
of that canyon.

626
00:37:28,523 --> 00:37:31,267
You want to see how fast they
take the ranch from us then?

627
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,633
It'll straighten your fucking
hair, that's how fast.

628
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:35,056
Bullshit.

629
00:37:35,157 --> 00:37:38,233
Ask him. Ask your husband.
Where the train station is,

630
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,367
and how many times
he's been there.

631
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,557
You want to know the real price
for protecting the ranch?

632
00:37:47,657 --> 00:37:50,200
I don't think you do.

633
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:53,798
If the goal is protecting the
ranch from future generations

634
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:55,666
of which you have none,

635
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,166
then monetizing the ranch
is the only option.

636
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,291
The airport was the only option
and you fucking know it!

637
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:03,466
You're a business woman.

638
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,898
How's the cattle business
treating you, Beth?

639
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:06,700
You see any long
term plays there?

640
00:38:06,724 --> 00:38:09,133
You know all of this!

641
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:10,889
And you can't convince him.

642
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:16,267
Well, I am guaranteeing the
ranch is passed down to Tate,

643
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:17,268
to my son.

644
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:20,466
To their children some day.

645
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,166
That is the promise that I made,

646
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,499
and that is the promise
I'm gonna keep.

647
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:28,999
The greatest threat
to that ranch is our father.

648
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:31,666
And you know that, too.

649
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,133
So <i>I</i> will remove the threat.

650
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:36,324
[floor creaks]

651
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:42,399
[music]

652
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:44,133
You'll take your
approval anywhere

653
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:46,023
you can find it,
won't you, Jamie?

654
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,922
I bet you are one
expensive hooker.

655
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:56,623
You enjoying your marionette?

656
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:01,789
Every inch of him.

657
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,157
Okay.
So, it's war.

658
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:09,391
The War's over, Beth.

659
00:39:12,856 --> 00:39:14,590
No, Jamie.

660
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:18,157
War is just beginning.

661
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,922
[music]

662
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:47,865
<i>And this just in.</i>

00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,965
<i>the radio collar studies

<i>So far, no comment from

When it rains it pours, huh?

674
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,066
They never reached
out for comment.

675
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,233
And nothing indicated they
were killed on your ranch.

676
00:40:14,257 --> 00:40:16,698
I mean, this is, this is...

677
00:40:16,722 --> 00:40:19,099
It's a hit piece, Clara.

678
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:20,434
They smell blood in the water.

679
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,657
- Who smells blood?
- Everyone.

680
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,503
Maybe you should take them
to the train station.

681
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,566
The what?

682
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,123
Could I have a moment
with my daughter?

683
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:53,599
Have a seat.

684
00:40:53,623 --> 00:40:54,956
No, I'll stand.

685
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,434
What do you want to know?

686
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,698
What is it?

687
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:04,965
Exactly.

688
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:08,300
[exhales]

689
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,989
It's the trash can
for everyone who's attacked us.

690
00:41:12,324 --> 00:41:13,898
It lays in a
jurisdictional dead zone

691
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:17,056
in a county with
a population of exactly zero.

692
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:19,334
Hence, no jury of your peers,

693
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:21,233
and no court for
a change in venue.

694
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:23,599
Why are you so surprised?

695
00:41:23,623 --> 00:41:26,133
Where did you think the men
who attacked you in your office

696
00:41:26,157 --> 00:41:28,133
and attacked our ranch went?

697
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:30,399
You're shocked we found
a way to circumvent

698
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:32,999
the consequences
of defending ourselves?

699
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,399
I'm shocked we need a way.

700
00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:36,999
But we do.
We always have.

701
00:41:37,023 --> 00:41:38,367
And unless we're willing
to walk away

702
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:39,765
from one hundred
and twenty years

703
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,698

into this ground,

704
00:41:41,722 --> 00:41:44,399
we always will.

00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:45,956
Jamie knows about it.

706
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,666
Yes.

707
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,466
Okay, I'm going to repeat
that, Dad.

708
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,458
Jamie knows about it.

709
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,133
I'm aware, Beth.

710
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:06,698
He will use everything
that he knows to destroy you.

711
00:42:06,722 --> 00:42:09,367
He has made it clear.

712
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:11,623
Yes, I believe he has.

713
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:16,324
[music]

714
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:40,434
If there is a place
our enemies go

715
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,633
and nobody ever knows
they went, Dad,

716
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:44,657
and they will never come back...

717
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:52,989
then I think that's
the place for Jamie.

718
00:42:58,391 --> 00:42:59,722
What do you think, Daddy?

719
00:43:01,757 --> 00:43:04,922
[music]

720
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:14,856

[Jamie winces]

722
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:21,633
Ow.

723
00:43:21,657 --> 00:43:22,698
Sorry.

724
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:25,133
I bet.

725
00:43:25,157 --> 00:43:27,832
She's a real piece of work,
your sister.

726
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,200
Oh, yeah.

727
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:31,690
She's a monster.

728
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:36,690
She always has been.

729
00:43:39,157 --> 00:43:41,765
She used to stab me under
the dinner table with a fork.

730
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,056
Mm-hm.

731
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:45,224
No reason, just for
the fun of it.

732
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,556
Actually, she's done
it as an adult.

733
00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:53,757
I would hardly refer
to your sister as an adult.

734
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,423
What do you think
she'll do next?

735
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,399
The truth?

736
00:44:04,423 --> 00:44:06,324
Yeah.

737
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:12,334
I'll think she'll
try to have me killed.

738
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,391
[chuckles]

739
00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:16,423
Come on...

740
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,722
You really think so?

741
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,690
Yes.

742
00:44:30,422 --> 00:44:34,200
Do you...
do you know anyone...

743
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:36,267
or, um...

744
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,798
is there a group

745
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:41,657
that has experience with
this kind of situation?

746
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:48,765
You assign
yourself security, Jamie.

747
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,889
That's playing defense.

748
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,267
[music]

749
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,523
What if I want to play...

750
00:44:59,523 --> 00:45:00,889
offense?

751
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:11,789
There are companies, yeah.

752
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:19,932
There's one in New York,
and there's one in Virginia.

753
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:21,590
How are they?

754
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,432
They're professionals.

755
00:45:27,456 --> 00:45:29,056
They're not hit men.

756
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:34,365
It will look like a...

757
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:37,623
heart attack or a car accident.

758
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:45,133
Perhaps I could meet with them,

759
00:45:45,157 --> 00:45:47,666
and see how
they would handle this.

760
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,733
Jamie, you don't
want to do that.

761
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:53,832
You tell me what you want,

762
00:45:53,856 --> 00:45:58,465
and I will meet with them.

763
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:02,898
See, if you're going to go
after her, you just might...

764
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:05,633
Maybe...

765
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:07,566
You know.

766
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,590
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking, too.

767
00:46:15,157 --> 00:46:18,233

00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:28,889
Hey, hey, hey.

770
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:39,532
What's so funny?

771
00:46:39,556 --> 00:46:41,265
What?

772
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:44,023
You're smiling like
the cat that ate the canary.

773
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:48,056
Oh. Didn't know I was.

774
00:46:48,157 --> 00:46:50,200
You got a big, old shit-eating
grin on your face

775
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,757
like you spent the night
in some girl's arms.

776
00:46:53,757 --> 00:46:55,432
- I do?
- Yeah.

777
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:57,765
They starting younger
and younger.

778
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,666
Okay.

779
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,456
[cattle lowing]

780
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:33,690
- Morning.
- Morning.

781
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:36,922
Just a couple more trucks
and we can go home.

782
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:41,265
Can we stop by the East Camp
on the way home?

783
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:43,365
How do you know about East Camp?

784
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:44,898
Your father told me.

785
00:47:44,922 --> 00:47:47,265
Said it was ours if we wanted.

786
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:49,432
If you'd help out while
the cowboys are gone

787
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:50,489
and he's in Helena.

788
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:53,965
Is that what you want?

789
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:56,265
Here's what I don't want.

790
00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:58,532
I don't want to go back
to a rented house

791
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:02,233
and stare at a nursery
that isn't filled.

792
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:03,757
And I don't want
to take it down.

793
00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:07,265
I'd rather move it.

794
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:09,523
Start over and
try again, you know?

795
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:12,590
Be nice to have
something of our own.

796
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:14,898
Yeah.

797
00:48:14,922 --> 00:48:16,999
We'd be living under this again.

798
00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:20,832
Well, I live under it anyway.

799
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,289
East Camp is not
much of a house, baby.

800
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:25,556
Yeah, but it would be ours.

801
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:30,698
[music]

802
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:34,822
In my vision,
the choice that I saw,

803
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:37,690
was between this place and you.

804
00:48:41,322 --> 00:48:42,856
Was East Camp in your vision?

805
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,989
Well, maybe this is the way
we have both.

806
00:48:54,157 --> 00:48:56,257
Okay, we'll take
a look at it then.

807
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:03,934
[laughs]

808
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,690
