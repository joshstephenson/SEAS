And you?

184

I'm a senior researcher
in the Theoretical Physics group

185
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,716
at Imperial College.

186
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,718
I'm doing a metastudy
analyzing the results

187

around the world.

started generating results

214
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,796
I went through the CERN code,
line by line. Nothing.

00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,217
The code for the centralized software?
How many lines is that?

It's a lot, Auggie.
It's a lot of fucking lines.

Okay, so what does Saul say?

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,817
He says it's impossible.

222
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,320
What about you?

223
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,698

Strange question, don't you think?

360
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,966
Yeah. Not as strange as jumping
into a Cherenkov tank, but sure.

361
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,259
Was she acting weird, or...

362

I don't know. Uh, yes?
But everything has been weird lately.

Don't be a dick, Jack.

Ah. No. Listen to him.
You were her favorite.

She'd have happily kept you on as

00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,128
How long has this stove been out?

535
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,048
Little Wenjie will freeze to death!
Fetch some coal.

536
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,968
[footsteps fade]

537
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,764
I asked to see you. Do you know why?

538
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,183
[door closes]

539
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,520
Because not only are you the daughter
of the disgraced Ye Zhetai,

540
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,106
but his star pupil as well.

541
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,609
In the eyes of many in the Party,

542
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,321
this makes you irredeemable.

543
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,408
But I don't see it that way.

544
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:46,120
I know of your own accomplishments
as a scholar.

545
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,581
I don't want your talent to go to waste.

546
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:57,381
All you need to do is sign this paper,
take a political class,

547
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:01,135
and you'll be approved
to rejoin the Construction Corps.

548
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,512
I'd like to read it, please.

549
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,140
[sighs, takes a deep breath]

550
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,601
You can trust me on this.

551
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:12,939
This document has nothing to do
with the Imperialist book.

[breathing shakily]

553
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,833
My father is dead.

554
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,670
But there are others in his field

555
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,880
still spreading dangerous ideas.

556
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,549
We lack evidence against them.

557
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,136
I've never seen my father
with any of these people.

558
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,639
The statements are all true.

559
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,934
Even your mother has signed.

560
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,604
See.

561
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,066
I cannot sign this.

562
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,027
I cannot testify.

563
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,238
If you fail to sign,

564
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,283
the Military Control Commission
will prosecute you.

565
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,909
At that stage,

566
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,204
I will be powerless to help.

Ye Wenjie.

579
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,365
I am Lei Zhicheng,
Political Commissar of Red Coast Base.

580
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,119
This is Yang Weining,
Chief Engineer of Red Coast Base.

581
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:18,999
Ye Wenjie, you are credited
as the author of this article.

582
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,459
Yes.

583
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,923
[in English] "The Possible Extenses of..."

584
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,217
"The Possible Existence

586
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,932
[in Mandarin] Yes. I wrote it.

587
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,685
We have a need for your specific talents.

588
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,897
The Commission has decided
to give you a chance.

589
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,984
Rehabilitate yourself here
rather than prison.

590
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,944
This is a military base.

591
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,530
The research here
is of the highest security classification.

592
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,532
And given your status,

593
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,868
if you stay,

594
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,036
you will never leave.

595
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,998
I want to go in.

596
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,709
[tense music playing]

597
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,795
I will stay here for the rest of my life.

606
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,522
Maybe. Some strange CCTV footage

619
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,223
I wouldn't say "sure."

621

<i>That must be some kind of record.</i>

623

Take it. She would want you to have it.

[Jin] I don't understand it.

633
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,416
I've tried.

634
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:53,380
But I just can't wrap my head around it,
why she would do that.

635
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,050
That wasn't Vera.

636
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:00,012
Her work... Things weren't going well.

637
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,807
I know. It's the same for all of us.

638
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:10,606
I'm sorry to ask, but did she leave
a note or any explanation?

[softly] Nothing.

640
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,158
She asked Saul about God.

641
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,868
Did she ever ask you?

642
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,370
About God?

We're not believers in this house.
We're scientists.

00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,061
[wind picks up]

716
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,572
[Jin grunting]

717
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,613
- [screams]
- [static crackles]

718
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,292
[breathing shakily]

719
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,795
What the fuck?

720
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,717
[Clarence] Wade really wants
one of these helmets.

721
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,719
Thinks they're highly relevant.

722
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,514
We ever seen one over here?

723
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,140
No, not yet.

724
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,643
What else is relevant?

725
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,019
Mike Evans.

726
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,939
That bicycle helmet looks expensive.

727
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,399
Evans is rich.

728
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,692
What about the countdowns?

729
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,777
Yes, if they happen to scientists.

730
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,321
Suicides, if they happen to scientists.

731
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,157
Anything strange happening
to scientists is relevant.

732
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,869
Anyone connected to anything strange
happening to scientists is relevant.

733
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,038
- Who decides what's relevant?
- Wade.

734
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,624
- Who decides he decides?
- Governments.

735
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,126
- [investigator] Which ones?
- Most.

736
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,713
They're not too keen on
the notion of science being broken.

737
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,882
I don't really understand
the science that's broken, to be honest.

738
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,052
I don't understand it either,
but it's not good.

739
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,054
[elevator bell chimes]

740
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,808
Just be glad you're not a scientist.

741
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,352
Shit time to be a scientist.

742
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,274
- [crickets chirping]
- [Auggie] You're smoking a lot of weed.

743
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,609
Yep. Is that why we're here?
This an intervention?

744
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,693
[Auggie] No.

745
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,822
- Well, what are we doing here?
- Not what you're thinking.

746
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,300
- I don't think anything.
- Yeah, you are. And it's not that.

747
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,994
You asked me to come, here I am,

748
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:44,291
on this moonless night,
in this beautiful place.

749
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,587
[in Spanish] You with all those curves
and me with no brakes.

750
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,713
[groans]

751
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,772
[exhales, in English] What did
that weird chick say to you again?

752
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,982
"Has the universe ever winked at you?"

753
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,111
She said to look at the sky at midnight
and gave me this.

754
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,613
[decoder clicks]

755
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,950
[Auggie] It came out of
a breakfast cereal. I looked it up.

756
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,495
They haven't made it since 1963.

757
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,374
- What's going on with you, though?
- I don't want you to know.

758
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,460
No confirmation bias.

759
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:32,089
Just watch, and let me know what
you observe, if you observe anything.

760
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,801
Science, dude.
That's why you're here, okay?

761
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,512
I understand my role. [clears throat]

762
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,182
Thank you for being here.

763
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,897
[Saul clears throat]

764
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,980
[clicking]

765
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,734
[Saul] It looks like Morse code,
but it's not.

766
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,487
- You know Morse code?
- I know all kind of shit.

767
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,282
Toasty-O-Sters.

768
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,953
I mean, it's not a very good name.
I could think of a better name.

769
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,704
I'd have to taste it first.

770
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,458
The name should reflect and support
what it feels like to eat the cereal.

771
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,002
It's toasted. Like, we know that much...

772
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,796
Shut up and observe.

773
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,717
Two minutes to midnight. [sighs]

774
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,888
[tense music playing]

775
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,807
[machinery whirring]

776
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,891
[in Mandarin] Sit.

777
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,156
Not everyone here agrees
with what is about to be done.

778
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,159
Given your political status.

779
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:46,913
On Chief Engineer Yang's recommendation,

780
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,082
we have decided

781
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:54,588
to inform you of the true nature
of the Red Coast Project.

782
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,466
[grunts] Stars are so bright tonight.

783
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,593
You're so high.

784
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,138
Yeah, but still,

785
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,807
they're pretty bright.

786
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,560
- [Auggie gasps]
- [bell tolling the hour]

787
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,730
[ominous orchestral music playing]

788
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,814
Saul.

789
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,068
[breathing shakily]

790
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,114
[quietly] Oh my God.

791
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,745
[in Mandarin] Red Coast is not
an experimental weapons program.

792
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,376
Go on.

793
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,925
The emissions from the system
are modulated.

794
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,595
Frequency modulation is not necessary
for weapons systems.

795
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,015
You are correct.

796
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,310
It is not necessary for weaponization.

797
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,731
But it is necessary for communication.

798
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,317
[bell continues tolling the hour]

799
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,402
[ominous music building]

800
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,533
[low rumbling]

801
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,875
[Saul] I observe the universe winking.

802
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,502
How can it be happening?

803
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,585
It can't.

804
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,256
[panting]

805
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,227
Shit. It's a code.

806
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,562
What?

807
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,730
[decoder clicking]

808
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,232
[Auggie] What does it say?

809
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,317
What does it say?

810
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,528
[in Mandarin] Communication...

811
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,445
with whom?

812
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,787
With whomever is out there.

813
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,667
[Clarence] What is that? [sighs]

814
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,629
That, Clarence, is our enemy.

815
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,550
It's not letters. It's just numbers.

816
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,884
Which numbers?

817
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,264
[Saul] Ten, thirty-four, zero, six,

818
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:13,518
five, four, three,

819
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,354
two, one.

820
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,898
[ominous music fades]

821
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,985
[tense music playing]

822
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,282
[clock ticking]

823
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,993
[Clarence] <i>Don't you want to know
why the stars flickered for you?</i>

824
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,914
[Jin] <i>This is what Vera was playing
before she killed herself.</i>

825
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:41,171
[man] <i>Your mission is to solve
the riddle of this world.</i>

826
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,924
<i>If one of us survives,</i>

827
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,385
<i>we all survive.</i>

828
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,679
[blows gently]

829
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,395
[Wade] <i>There's someone behind everything.</i>

830
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,146
<i>You just have to dig.</i>

831
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,401
[speaking inaudibly]

832
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,155
My Lord, we can help you.

833
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,615
[tense music building]

834
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,709
[Jin] <i>I think they're real.</i>

835
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,252
<i>And they're coming.</i>

836
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,796
[music swells]

837
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,383
[explosion blasts]

838
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,807
[somber closing theme playing]

839
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,924
[closing theme fades]
