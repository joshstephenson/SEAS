00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,500
Okay.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Come with me.

186
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,666
Come with me.

187
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,250
Dude's standing there, ass naked.

188
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,875
No joke, no chonies, nothing.

189
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,250
Talking about his time
walkin' with the elders.

190
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,958
He's here from 1972.
And you know that type of...

191
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,041
1972?

192
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,791
1982.

193
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,875
Damn it!

194
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,666
This is bad, isn't it?

195
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,458
No, no, it's good.

196
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,125
I mean, story's moving along.

197
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,416
I'm believing you.

198
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,208
Shit, it sucks, bro.

199
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,500
Oh, stranger danger.

200
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,250
Light 'em up.

201
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,833
[siren wails, chirps]

202
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,166
Sir, roll your windows down.

203
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,000
I got a wounded woman in here.

204
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,083
Edgar, it's your cousin, Joy.

205
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,291
Hands on the steering wheel.

206
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,375
- What?
- [Edgar] Now.

207
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,517
- [Joy] No, guys!
- Alright, alright.

208
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,791
Joy, what the fuck is going on?

209
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,666
He's taking me to IHS.

210
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,583
[sighs]

211
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,434
Why are your people here?
They looking for you?

212
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,416
Just hold 'em off, okay?

213
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,750
Dan, host our friends.

214
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,833
Got it.

215
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,208
Get back on the road.

216
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,750
IHS is a few more miles out.

217
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,833
Alright.

218
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,291
Autumn.

219
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,958
Autumn.

220
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,625
"Fear not for nothing is covered
that will not be revealed.

221
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,458
Nothing hidden
that will not be known."

222
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,083
Remember when the pastor said that?

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,458
If you're scared to go in there,
you need to rethink God.

224
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,041
Come on, Cecilia.

225
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,476
She's a woman in need,
the Abbots are in need.

226
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,684
Instead of putting it all on God,

227
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,642
why don't you take
some responsibility for yourself?

228
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,934
- You're responsible for that.
- Think of what you're saying.

229
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,125
And you're misleading people.

230
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,708
And they'll waste their entire lives

231
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,916
under this false deception
and delusion of faith.

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,625
[Pastor Ken]
Autumn! What are you doing?

233
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,309
- Cecilia...
- [Autumn] She needs $500,000

234
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,583
or she's gonna lose her ranch.

235
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,875
She's gonna lose it forever.

236
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,375
Cecilia, is that true?

237
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,541
Mm-hmm.

238
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,791
[Pastor Ken]
Oh, Cecilia.

239
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,166
So find the money. Help her out.

240
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,291
We don't have $500,000.

241
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,791
This church does not have $500,000.

242
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,250
This is a simple church.

243
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,875
This is a town full of old money.

244
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,517
- My congregation would do anything...
- Are they exempt from doing God's work?

245
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,416
...to help Cecilia,
but we do not have that.

246
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,458
Autumn, why didn't you tell me
this is what you were gonna do?

247
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,458
Because I knew
that you wouldn't come with me if...

248
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,833
You're asking the people
of this church for money,

249
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,041
money they don't have,
while your family is rich.

250
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,500
Why?

251
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,500
Because I want you to see
what these people are really like,

252
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,000
who they actually are.

253
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,041
Well, be the example
you want them to be.

254
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,583
Call. Ask your family for money.

255
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,916
Amen to that.

256
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,750
[beeps]

257
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,309
- [automated response] <i>We're sorry.</i>
- [sighs]

258
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,541
<i>You have reached a number
that has been disconnected</i>

259
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,750
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

260
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,083
That's weird. I...

261
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,500
I think my sister
will know where she is.

262
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,708
[line rings]

263
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,083
[beeps]

264
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,583
[automated response]
<i>We're sorry.</i>

265
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,833
<i>You have reached a number
that has been disconnected</i>

266
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,750
<i>or is no longer in service.</i>

267
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,958
Beware of false prophets
kicking and screaming for miracles

268
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,458
while you're unknowingly being rebuked
for your vanity,

269
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,666
'cause I see you
for who you really are,

270
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,250
and that's a dime-store philosopher,

271
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,166
sanctimonious huckster
with nothing worth buying.

272
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,708
And I bet your family
abandoned you a long time ago.

273
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,250
Pastor, you're taking the high road?

274
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,625
- That's not Christlike.
- [Pastor Ken] Cecilia, spare yourself.

275
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,208
Not all people can be saved.

276
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,083
Well, how do you know if you don't try?

277
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,333
Today she tried.

278
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,958
Cecilia.

279
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,333
You alright?

280
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,750
Yeah.

281
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,625
You're somethin' else.

282
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,541
What do you mean?

283
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,833
When you believe in something,

284
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,500
nothing's gonna change your mind.

285
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,666
Yeah, that's just who I am.

286
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,625
Well, it's who I am too.

287
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,958
But I had forgotten.

288
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,041
You just reminded me.
Thank you.

289
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,517
I thought you would've been mad.

290
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,333
I am. No, I am.

291
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,875
Well...

292
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,458
You know, there's only one person I know
who can get that angry.

293
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,750
- Who?
- Amy.

294
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,208
I'm so worried
that I've missed who I am.

295
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,916
I've just been blind to so many things.

296
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,708
We all are.

297
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,458
Yeah, we all are.

298
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,333
[sighs]

299
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,625
First time at IHS?

300
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Sure.

301
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,750
Can I ask you a question?

302
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,458
You just did.

303
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,041
Where'd you find Joy again?

304
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,250
[sighs]

305
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,458
What's your real question?

306
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,958
The one I just asked.

307
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,500
You know, let's say I did
something bad to your cousin,

308
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,063
would it make a lot of sense
that I would bring her here after?

309
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,666
- Good point.
- [Royal] Hmm.

310
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,166
Domestics do it all the time.

311
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,041
She was shot when you found her?

312
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,125
- She was.
- [Edgar] Hmm.

313
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,458
And, uh, you just did
the neighborly thing?

314
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,833
Again, get to what you're asking.

315
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,875
Did you put your fuckin' hands
on my family?

316
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,458
[sighs]

317
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,083
Only to get her here.

318
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,291
[Levi]
<i>Go on, Royal.</i>

319
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,583
<i>Sight down like I taught you.</i>

320
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,125
Look, I'm not trying to be an asshole.

321
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,333
Just don't think
you're gonna believe anything I tell you.

322
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,125
[Royal grunts softly]

323
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,791
[Edgar] You alright?

324
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,416
Yeah. Yeah, I'm alright.

325
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,833
Alright.

326
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,458
Uh, I'm gonna go check on Joy.

327
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,416
Hey.

328
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,541
I'm Deputy Jess Chinlund.

329
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,708
Amelia County Sheriff's Department.

330
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,250
What do you want, Deputy Jess Chinlund?

331
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,125
[Jess] What's your name?

332
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,208
Daniel.

333
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,291
Look, Dan, uh...

334
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,666
I got this feeling that I can't shake

335
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,791
that our boss is, uh,
in your jurisdiction right now.

336
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,583
And?

337
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,625
And I really need to know if she's okay.

338
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,666
Well, Deputy Sheriff...

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,041
you're just gonna
have to wait in your car.

340
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,666
I just wanna make sure she's okay.

341
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,958
[nurse] Joy's awake.

342
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,666
She wants to see you.

343
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,000
You sure about that now?

344
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,625
She said the white guy.

345
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:03,916
Thank you.

346
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,833
Still feelin' shitty?

347
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,291
Kinda.

348
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,375
[Royal] Hmm.

349
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,166
Thank you again.

350
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,458
[sighs]

351
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,208
You wanna start or should I?

352
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,250
What are we startin'?

353
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,291
Fine.

354
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,708
I ended up in your West Pasture
'cause I time traveled through that hole.

355
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,500
Figured I'd cut through
all the bullshit.

356
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:10,958
Mm-hmm.

357
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,625
That's not a question.

358
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,708
[Joy scoffs]

359
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,208
[Joy] Right.

360
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,416
I lived in the 1880s for four years.

361
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:30,416
Met Shoshone,
hunted with them, made friends...

about you being an Abbott.
