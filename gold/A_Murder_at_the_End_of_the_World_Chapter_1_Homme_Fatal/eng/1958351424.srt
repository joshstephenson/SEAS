There are 40,000

very accurate about my vices.

722
00:48:40,104 --> 00:48:42,075

724

[Andy] So, um...

725
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:53,030
I've met some of my closest
friends during these retreats.

726
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,967
And some incredible innovations

727
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,406
have come about from
those encounters.

728
00:48:57,439 --> 00:49:00,211
It really is amazing what
people can offer the world

729
00:49:00,244 --> 00:49:02,048
with proper support.

730
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:07,225
I'm emerging from the isolation

731
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:09,530
of the past few years with
a couple of surprises.

732
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,570
The first, you've
already met: Ray.

733
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:14,106
He's in the beta phase,

734
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:16,311
but I think his
introduction to the world

735
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:19,249
could be something
of a revelation.

736
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:22,356
Personal assistant,
teacher, therapist.

737
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:24,861
Some people would
refer to him as

738
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:26,230
artificial intelligence.

739
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,134
I prefer the term...

740
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,472
- alternative intelligence.
- Alternative intelligence.

00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:32,242

The second surprise

744
00:49:38,153 --> 00:49:40,492
is, uh, bringing you
all here to Iceland.

745
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:46,371
Now, you're the first people
to stay in this hotel.

746
00:49:46,404 --> 00:49:48,942
And the reason that I built it

747
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:50,879
is because I believe

748
00:49:50,912 --> 00:49:53,150
we're in one of the last true

749
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:56,357

No, please, don't give him that.

751

- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

By the time this
little one is 18,

753
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:06,845
this planet that we call home

754
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,848
could be past the
point of no return.

refugees projected by 2050.

758
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:21,541

759

The facts are hysterical,
but they are accurate.

760
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,918
They are facts.

761
00:50:26,951 --> 00:50:30,158
Margaret Atwood
said in an article

762
00:50:30,191 --> 00:50:32,596
that the nearer we get
to the climate crisis,

763
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,199
the fewer choices we have,

764
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,069
but we still have some,

765
00:50:36,102 --> 00:50:37,873
and we have to
start making them.

766
00:50:39,075 --> 00:50:41,280
Now, some of you
are technologists,

767
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:44,387
some of you are deeply
critical of technology.

768
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,558
Some of you have

769
00:50:46,591 --> 00:50:49,262
designer degrees, some of
you dropped out of college

770
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:52,436
like I did, but everyone
sitting here at this table

771
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:55,909
is an original thinker.

772
00:50:55,942 --> 00:50:57,947
That's why you're here.

773
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,450
And it is original thought,

774
00:50:59,483 --> 00:51:00,953
more than money,

776
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:07,098
