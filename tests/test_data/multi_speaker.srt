How did you get this toxic propaganda?

519

It isn't mine.

520
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,771
It's in English.

521
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,649
You speak English. Who else's could it be?

522
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:16,197
A truthful response
is in your best interest.

00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,620
[Song] You will pay the price

525

if you are protecting someone.

526

[door closes]

539
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:29,520
Because not only are you the daughter
of the disgraced Ye Zhetai,

but his star pupil as well.

541
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,609
In the eyes of many in the Party,

542
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,321
this makes you irredeemable.

543

I know of your own accomplishments
as a scholar.

545

I don't want your talent to go to waste.

546
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:57,381
All you need to do is sign this paper,
take a political class,

547
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:01,135
and you'll be approved
to rejoin the Construction Corps.

548

556
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,549
We lack evidence against them.

557

I've never seen my father
with any of these people.

If you fail to sign,

the Military Control Commission
will prosecute you.

565

At that stage,

Ye Wenjie, you are credited
as the author of this article.

Rehabilitate yourself here

The research here
is of the highest security classification.

592
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,532

Most people have to wait longer.

674
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,018
What are we testing?

675
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,811
Missiles?

676
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,981
Everybody has missiles.

677
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:21,945
[man on PA] <i>Target Coordinates: BN20197F,</i>

678

[somber music playing]

699
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,381
Those were the coordinates for the target.

700
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,133
You have a good memory.

701
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,471
What is the target?

702
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,183
[wind gusting]

703
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,269

[breathing shakily]

719
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,795
What the fuck?

720
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,717
[Clarence] Wade really wants
one of these helmets.

721
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,719
Thinks they're highly relevant.

722
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,514
We ever seen one over here?

723
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,140
No, not yet.

724
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,643
What else is relevant?

725
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,019
Mike Evans.

726
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,939
That bicycle helmet looks expensive.

727
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,399
Evans is rich.

728
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,692
What about the countdowns?

729
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,777
Yes, if they happen to scientists.

730
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,321
Suicides, if they happen to scientists.

731
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,157
Anything strange happening
to scientists is relevant.

732
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,869
Anyone connected to anything strange
happening to scientists is relevant.

733
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,038
- Who decides what's relevant?
- Wade.

734
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,624
- Who decides he decides?
- Governments.

735
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,126
- [investigator] Which ones?
- Most.

736
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,713
They're not too keen on
the notion of science being broken.

737
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,882
I don't really understand
the science that's broken, to be honest.

738
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,052
I don't understand it either,
but it's not good.

739
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,054
[elevator bell chimes]

740
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,808
Just be glad you're not a scientist.

741
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,352
Shit time to be a scientist.

742
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,274
- [crickets chirping]
- [Auggie] You're smoking a lot of weed.

743
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,609
Yep. Is that why we're here?
This an intervention?

744
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,693
[Auggie] No.

745
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,822
- Well, what are we doing here?
- Not what you're thinking.

746
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,300
- I don't think anything.
- Yeah, you are. And it's not that.

747
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,994
You asked me to come, here I am,

748
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:44,291
on this moonless night,
in this beautiful place.

749
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,587
[in Spanish] You with all those curves
and me with no brakes.

750
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,713
[groans]

751
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,772
[exhales, in English] What did
that weird chick say to you again?

752
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,982
"Has the universe ever winked at you?"

753
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,111
She said to look at the sky at midnight
and gave me this.

754
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,613
[decoder clicks]

755
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,950
[Auggie] It came out of
a breakfast cereal. I looked it up.

756
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,495
They haven't made it since 1963.

757
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,374
- What's going on with you, though?
- I don't want you to know.

758
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,460
No confirmation bias.

759
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:32,089
Just watch, and let me know what
you observe, if you observe anything.

760
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,801
Science, dude.
That's why you're here, okay?

761
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,512
I understand my role. [clears throat]

762
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,182
Thank you for being here.

763
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,897
[Saul clears throat]

764
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,980
[clicking]

765
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,734
[Saul] It looks like Morse code,
but it's not.

766
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,487
- You know Morse code?
- I know all kind of shit.

767
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,282
Toasty-O-Sters.

768
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,953
I mean, it's not a very good name.
I could think of a better name.

769
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,704
I'd have to taste it first.

770
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,458
The name should reflect and support
what it feels like to eat the cereal.

771
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,002
It's toasted. Like, we know that much...

772
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,796
Shut up and observe.

773
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,717
Two minutes to midnight. [sighs]

774
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,888
[tense music playing]

775
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,807
[machinery whirring]

776
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,891
[in Mandarin] Sit.

777
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,156
Not everyone here agrees
with what is about to be done.

778
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,159
Given your political status.

779
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:46,913
On Chief Engineer Yang's recommendation,

780
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,082
we have decided

781
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:54,588
to inform you of the true nature
of the Red Coast Project.

782
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,466
[grunts] Stars are so bright tonight.

783
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,593
You're so high.

784
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,138
Yeah, but still,

785
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,807
they're pretty bright.

786
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,560
- [Auggie gasps]
- [bell tolling the hour]

787
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,730
[ominous orchestral music playing]

788
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:12,814
Saul.

789
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,068
[breathing shakily]

790
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,114
[quietly] Oh my God.

791
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,745
[in Mandarin] Red Coast is not
an experimental weapons program.

792
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,376
Go on.

793
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,925
The emissions from the system
are modulated.

794
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,595
Frequency modulation is not necessary
for weapons systems.

795
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,015
You are correct.

796
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,310
It is not necessary for weaponization.

797
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,731
But it is necessary for communication.

798
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:57,317
[bell continues tolling the hour]

799
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,402

[low rumbling]

801
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,875
[Saul] I observe the universe winking.

802
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,502
How can it be happening?

803
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,585
It can't.

804
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,256
[panting]

805
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,227
Shit. It's a code.

806
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,562
What?

807
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,730
[decoder clicking]

808
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,232
[Auggie] What does it say?

809
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,317
What does it say?

810
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,528
[in Mandarin] Communication...

811
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,445
with whom?

812
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,787
With whomever is out there.

813
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,667
[Clarence] What is that? [sighs]

814
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:59,629
That, Clarence, is our enemy.

815
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,550
It's not letters. It's just numbers.

816
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,884
Which numbers?

817
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,264
[Saul] Ten, thirty-four, zero, six,

818
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:13,518
five, four, three,

819
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,354
two, one.

[Clarence] <i>Don't you want to know
why the stars flickered for you?</i>

824
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,914
[Jin] <i>This is what Vera was playing
before she killed herself.</i>

825
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:41,171
[man] <i>Your mission is to solve
the riddle of this world.</i>

826
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,924
<i>If one of us survives,</i>

827
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,385
<i>we all survive.</i>

828

[blows gently]

[speaking inaudibly]

832
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,155
My Lord, we can help you.

[Jin] <i>I think they're real.</i>

835
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,252
<i>And they're coming.</i>

836
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,796
[music swells]
